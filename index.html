    <h1>🥐Croissant</h1>

    <p>A croissant is a light flaky, and buttery viennoiserie pastry. It is named for its historical crescent shape. A croissant is made of layered yeast-leavened dough. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.</p>
